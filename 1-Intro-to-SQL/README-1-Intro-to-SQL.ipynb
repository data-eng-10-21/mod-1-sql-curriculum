So far, we have used simply used CSV to store or data, or perhaps in a past life we have some experience with Microsoft Excel.  These are good tools, but when the size of our data increases and as the questions we have about the data become more complex, we need to move to relational databases like SQL."

For example, the first employee will automatically be assigned the id 1, and the second employee will be assigned the id 2. \n",

For each individual member of a table, we will have a separate row, and each attribute of that row is in a column. \n",
