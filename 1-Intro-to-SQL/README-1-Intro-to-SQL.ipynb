So far, we have used simply used CSV to store or data, or perhaps in a past life we have some experience with Microsoft Excel.  These are good tools, but when the size of our data increases and as the questions we have about the data become more complex, we need to move to relational databases like SQL."

    "Two of the most common data types are Integer and Text. You can view a list of other common data types [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp). When determining what data type to use for a column, we need to think not just about what the data represents (i.e. a number), but also how we may want to manipulate and organize that data. Our name column really only has one data type that would work, TEXT. But it isn't always this simple. For example, our column phone_number is being stored as TEXT, but it could also be stored as an integer. Storing data as an integer could be helpful if we wanted to compare the size of integers, or if we wanted to perform certain mathematical calculations on the data (i.e. the mean). Since we don't compare phone numbers in that way (we probably aren't interested in the average phone number or the sum of phone numbers), in this case, it makes more sense to store it as text.\n",

    "\n",
    "A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. Primary keys must contain unique values. When we include id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, we are inlcuding a column that will act as a primary key for each row in the table. AUTOINCREMENT just means that SQL will automatically update each new row in the table with the next available primary key. This will become more clear later on, when we begin to add data to our tables\n"
