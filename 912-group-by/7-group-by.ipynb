    "Now so far, when we have queried for aggregate information, we have done by asking questions about the entire table, or a single subset of the table.  For example, we could answer a question about the average rating of a restaurant in the Bronx, and then perhaps a separate query about the average restaurant rating in Queens.  But what if we'd like to organize our data into different groups based on the neighborhood, and then calculate the average rating of each group of restaurants?  For that we use group by.  "
