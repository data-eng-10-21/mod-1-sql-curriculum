    "Using the SELECT statement in sql is how we query the data in the database. We use the SELECT statement to retrieve exactly the data we are interested in analyzing.

For example, if our employees table had a 1,000,000 rows but we only wanted to see those rows for employees that started after a certain date, we would use a filter to limit the results of a query. The `WHERE` clause is how we filter in our SELECT statements. \n",
