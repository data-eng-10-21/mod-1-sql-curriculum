    "So far we have only worked with two of the most common datatypes: Integer and Text.  You can view a list of other common data types [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp). When determining what data type to use for a column, we need to think not just about what the data represents (i.e. a number), but also how we may want to manipulate and organize that data. Our name column really only has one data type that would work, TEXT. But it isn't always this simple. For example, our column phone_number is being stored as TEXT, but it could also be stored as an integer. Storing data as an integer could be helpful if we wanted to compare the size of integers, or if we wanted to perform certain mathematical calculations on the data (i.e. the mean). Since we don't compare phone numbers in that way (we probably aren't interested in the average phone number or the sum of phone numbers), in this case, it makes more sense to store it as text."
